Class

- Decoder
- Control Logic
    - Add cycles for 
        Instruction Decode
        Intermediate registers and FIFOs
- Buffer Base Class with double buffer
    - IBUF
    - OBUF
    - WBUF
    - BBUF
    - load
        - use a tag and compute Stats
    - compute
        - use a tag and update number of read and writes
    - store 
        - use a tag and compute Stats
    - Have dependency check and error if tags are filled

- Compute
    - Takes in the loop information and outputs the cycles needed and mem accesses requires.
    - Mem accesses gets updated into the buffers?

- Pipeline
    Working:
        - Calls execute function inside every class.
        - Execute updates the variables like cycles, accesses, tag etc.
            - cycles are for that load itself? There can be 2 different variables for cycles, one for that tile and other accumulating
        
- Stats
